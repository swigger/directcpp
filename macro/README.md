`directcpp` is yet another method to interop c++ with rust.

It's designed to be lightweight, efficient, MSVC-friendly, no cpp side code generation, work with outer c++ build tools like visual studio.

If you're looking for a way to work with c++ and rust with *Visual Studio*, `directcpp` might be the result.

This is the proc-macro project. Read main [README.md](https://github.com/swigger/directcpp/blob/master/README.md) for more.
